#  POLI 179 Project


### Research Question: 
Is there a relationship between the language used to report Pro-Palestine student protests and the news media site's political bias?

### Hypothesis: 
New media sites that are more right-leaning would use more negative language when reporting Pro-Palestine student protests in comparison to left-leaning media sites. 


### In this repo: 

`google news data collection.ipynb`: a notebook about our data collection techniques  
`news and keywords.xlsx`: keywords and news sites we used for data collection  

`clustering_analysis.ipynb`: a notebook where we use PCA to cluster news headlines for more insight  

everything else: data


### Moving Forward: 

* we need to find more analysis techniques: 
   - thinking of using TFIDF to find words that are representative of each news sites' language surrounding the topic
   - regression using political bias score and sentiment of news headline to see if there is a relationship 
   - adding politcial bias score to the clusters we have to see if there is a relationship 
* any other suggestions or for how we can improve on these ideas?

* to do: 
    - create visualizations for these analysis
    - create word cloud of the different clusters
    
* issues we have: 
   - finding a good way to represent political bias
