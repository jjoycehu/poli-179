## Introduction
   From the beginning of March 2024, the United States has experienced nationwide demonstrations across various college and university campuses. Students took to their campuses to protest Israel’s actions against the Palestinian people and show solidarity for the Palestinianes affected by Israel. The students called for their respective university to divest all assets tied to or supporting the state of Israel as a form of protest and dissatisfaction with Israel’s conduct. In response to the protests, many universities sought to shut down the demonstrations by having police crackdown on protesters leading to arrests and disciplinary action. Due to the amount of protests from high profile universities such as Harvard, Brown, etc. inspiring action to take place across the nation, major news outlets were quick to report on keeping up with every demonstration.

  Regardless of one’s opinion on the overall highly polarizing issue of Israel and Palestine, we believe this presented a unique opportunity to study media bias on this particular issue due to how polarizing it has been. Primarily, we seek to answer the question; Is there a relationship between the language used to report Pro-Palestine student protests and the media’s own political bias? We believe that media outlets that lean to the right politically would be found to use more generally negative language when it comes to reporting the Pro-Palestine student protests compared to their left leaning counterparts. For example, we expect that right leaning media sources would use words such as “disruption,” and  “agitators,” that paint the demonstrations in a more negative light while left leaning media sources may use language such as “walk-out,” “solidarity,” and “peaceful” to paint a more positive light of the protests.


### Research Question: 
Is there a relationship between the language used to report Pro-Palestine student protests and the news media site's political bias?

### Hypothesis: 
New media sites that are more right-leaning would use more negative language when reporting Pro-Palestine student protests in comparison to left-leaning media sites.
