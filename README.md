### Research Question: 
Is there a relationship between the language used to report Pro-Palestine student protests and the news media site's political bias?

### Hypothesis: 
New media sites that are more right-leaning would use more negative language when reporting Pro-Palestine student protests in comparison to left-leaning media sites.
